# Leap Year
As a user, I want to know if a year is a leap year, So that I can plan for an extra day on February 29th during those years.

# Purpose
This game is developed in React using Test Driven Development approach.

# Functional cases
1) All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years e.g. 2000 
2) All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years e.g. 1700, 1800, 2100 and 1900 
3) All years divisible by 4 but not by 100 ARE leap years e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016
4) All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years e.g. 2017, 2018, 2019
